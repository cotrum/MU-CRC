        <h2>What is a Jump Box?</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Jump Box</strong> (also known as a <strong>Jump Server</strong> or <strong>Bastion Host</strong>) is a secure intermediary system used in cybersecurity to manage and access devices in a protected network. It acts as a controlled gateway between external users and internal systems, allowing administrators to connect to sensitive network segments without exposing them directly to the internet.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>Why Use a Jump Box?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduced Attack Surface:</strong> By centralizing access through a single hardened system, you minimize the number of entry points for attackers.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Jump boxes enforce strict access controls, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and limited user permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity Monitoring:</strong> All access to internal systems is logged, providing an audit trail for security teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolation of Sensitive Systems:</strong> Internal systems are not directly exposed to the internet, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Does a Jump Box Work?</h2>
        <p>Here’s a step-by-step explanation of how a jump box operates:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An administrator connects to the jump box from their workstation.</li>
            <li>The jump box authenticates the user (e.g., using MFA or SSH keys).</li>
            <li>Once authenticated, the administrator can access internal systems (e.g., servers in a DMZ or private network) through the jump box.</li>
            <li>Firewall rules restrict direct access to internal systems, ensuring that all traffic must pass through the jump box.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div class="section-box">
        <h2>Key Features of a Jump Box</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hardened Security:</strong> The jump box is configured with strict security measures to resist attacks.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Only authorized users can connect to the jump box.</li>
            <li><strong>Logging and Monitoring:</strong> All activity is logged for auditing and analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Segmentation:</strong> The jump box acts as a bridge between different network zones (e.g., external and DMZ).</li>
        </ul>
